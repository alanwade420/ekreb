Changer society challenge 

Hello Changer Soceity. It's me, Alan Wade.

Y'all's former co president, current senior advisor, and perpetual narcissist--Berke Lunstad (or should I say ekreb...)--bet me thirty dollars I couldn't
do this challenge in MATLAB, and this bitch told me it was IMPOSSIBLE. Since I love taking money from men, especially from scammers like ekreb, I was like slay let's do it. 

Here's a lil tutorial for y'all since Berke said nobody will know how to use MATLAB </3
  
 ## setting up
  1. Download all my .m files (and the jpg but DONT LOOK AT IT ITS A SURPRISE)
  2. Put them in one folder
  3. Open MATLAB, and look at the top left for a little folder icon with a green arrow coming out of it and click on it
  4. Select the folder with all the downloaded files
     
  ## running MATLAB ekreb !
  
  7. ok enter ekreb in the command window and hit enter
  8. i HIGHLY recommend entering hintplease next...
  9. you MUST enter your answer in the correct format, your answers must be in quotations, AND you must enter all six responses at once otherwise MATLAB will get pissy at you

Enioy ladies and pls give me a high score I worked really hard to scam ekreb <3
